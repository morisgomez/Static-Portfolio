          <h3>
            Moris was born in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador - located in Central America and raised in South Central, Los Angeles, California. He is a first generation, system-impacted immigrant and the first in his immediate family to attend and complete undergraduate university studies. He graduated from UCLA in June 2023 with a Bachelors (BA) in International Development Studies and Economics. Although his academic focus during undergraduate studies was in the social sciences, Moris constantly found himself tinkering with technology outside the classroom. Moris developed a keen interest in programming and began self-learning web engineering while being a full-time student at UCLA. He is currently enrolled in a computer science certificate program at El Camino College where he is furthering his knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, program design, and operating systems. Meshing his background in the social sciences with computer science, his professional passion resides in the engineering of software that helps challenge our socioeconomic inequities both at the macro and micro level. On his down-time, Moris enjoys tinkering with creative programming, adding to his book collection, playing pick-up soccer, and spending time with his 10 cats.
